# Web_Design_HTML_CSS
This is my personal version control and backup of files on the projects I did as part of an online course on freeCodeCamp. 

I am currently enrolled in the "Responsive Web Design" course on freeCodeCamp, where I am delving into the foundational languages for webpage creation:
- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content.
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.

**Description:** I developed the Cat Photo App as part of an online course on freeCodeCamp to reinforce my understanding of HTML basics. The project allowed me to practice structuring web pages and creating simple interactive elements.

**Features:**
- Display cat photos
- Basic interactive elements
- Show a Simple Form
