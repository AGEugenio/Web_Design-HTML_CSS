# Web_Design_HTML_CSS
This is my personal backup of files on the projects I did as part of one of the online course on freeCodeCamp. 

I am currently enrolled in the "<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/">Responsive Web Design</a>" course on freeCodeCamp, where I am delving into the foundational languages for webpage creation:
- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content.
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.
